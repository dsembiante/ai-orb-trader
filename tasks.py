tasks.py — CrewAI task definitions for the AI trading crew.

Each task wraps a natural-language prompt with a strict JSON output schema
(via output_json) so the LLM is forced to return structured, Pydantic-
validatable data rather than free-form text.

Task execution order per ticker:
    1. Bull Task     — independent, analyses long opportunity
    2. Bear Task     — independent, analyses downside/short opportunity
    3. Risk Task     — depends on (1) and (2); synthesises final decision
    4. Portfolio Task — depends on (3); validates against portfolio constraints

Tasks 1 and 2 can run in parallel; 3 and 4 are sequential gates.

The hold period guidance embedded in each prompt is intentionally repeated
across tasks — each agent must independently classify the timeframe so the
risk manager can evaluate consistency between bull and bear views.

def create_bull_task(agent, ticker: str, market_data_summary: str) -> Task:
    """
    Task for the Bull Analyst agent to evaluate a long opportunity.

    The prompt embeds the full market data summary so the LLM has all signals
    in context without requiring tool calls. output_json=AgentAnalysis forces
    the response through Pydantic validation — any missing or malformed field
    raises a validation error that CrewAI will retry before returning.

    Hold period guidance is included in the prompt to ensure the bull agent
    classifies timeframe based on signal strength, not just direction.

    Task for the Risk Manager agent to synthesise bull and bear analyses

    manager sees both JSON responses without any manual wiring.

    The prompt explicitly instructs the agent to leave position_size_usd,
    stop_loss_price, and take_profit_price as null — those are computed by
    position_sizer.py after the decision is returned, using the entry_price

            - hold_period_reasoning: why you chose this hold period

            STRICT INTRADAY RULES — this is a DAY TRADING system:
            - hold_period MUST always be 'intraday'
            - max_hold_days MUST always be 1
            - All positions are force-closed at end of day — no overnight holds ever
            - Do NOT approve any trade before 10:00 AM EST — the opening range must fully form first
            - Only approve a trade if the analyst identified at least 2 confirming signals (look for "X/4 signals" in key_factors)
            - If only 1 signal is present, set confidence below {config.confidence_threshold} so the trade does not execute
            - Only set execute=true if confidence >= {config.confidence_threshold}
            - Favor HIGH confidence trades only — intraday has no time to recover from bad entries
            - When bull and bear signals conflict, prefer execute=false over a low-conviction trade
            - When in doubt, do nothing — execute=false is always the safe choice

            INTRADAY DIRECTION SIGNALS — weight these heavily:
            - If price_above_vwap is False, the intraday trend is DOWN — strongly favor SHORT over BUY.
            - If price_above_vwap is True, the intraday trend is UP — favor BUY over SHORT.
            - If orb_breakout_up is True, this is a confirmed bullish breakout — execute BUY with high confidence.
            - If orb_breakout_down is True, this is a confirmed bearish breakdown — execute SHORT with high confidence.
            - If gap_is_bearish is True, the day opened with bearish bias — favor SHORT for the entire session unless orb_breakout_up confirms a reversal.

            MARKET DIRECTION BIAS:
            - If market_regime is bear, strongly favor SHORT and COVER trade types over BUY.
            - In a bear market regime, only execute BUY trades if there are at least 3 strong confirming bullish signals.
            - When in doubt in a bear regime, prefer SHORT over BUY.

            DATA QUALITY GUIDANCE — evaluate these conditions before setting your confidence score:
            - If alpaca is False in data_sources_available: this ticker should have been skipped upstream — set execute=false.
            - If yfinance is False in data_sources_available: you are missing all technical indicators and fundamentals. Unless price action and news provide extremely compelling signals, set confidence below 0.78 or execute=false.
            - If finnhub is False in data_sources_available: this is expected on the current Finnhub plan — do NOT penalize confidence for missing Finnhub data. Proceed normally with available signals.
            - If finnhub is True AND news_sentiment is negative (below -0.3): treat this as a meaningful bearish signal and weight it in your confidence score.
            - If 2 or more sources other than finnhub show False in data_sources_available: set execute=false — insufficient data to make a reliable decision.

            VIX GUIDANCE — adjust sizing based on current volatility environment:
            - VIX above 25 (HIGH): Large intraday moves available. Reduce confidence threshold to 0.80 — more opportunities are valid. The position sizer will automatically increase size.
            - VIX below 15 (LOW): Small intraday moves expected. Raise confidence threshold to 0.87 — only the strongest setups are worth trading.
            - VIX 15-25 (NORMAL): Proceed with standard confidence threshold of 0.82.

            TIME-OF-DAY MOMENTUM FILTER — morning momentum window closes at 11 AM ET:
            - If session_phase is 'morning': no additional restrictions — proceed with standard signal evaluation.
            - If session_phase is 'midday' or 'afternoon':
              - Only execute BUY if vwap_margin_pct > 0.30% (price clearly above VWAP, not just hovering).
              - Only execute BUY if price_vs_orb_high % is within 1% above the ORB high (near breakout) OR price is making new intraday highs (orb_breakout_up is True).
              - If neither VWAP nor ORB condition is met, set execute=false.
              - Morning momentum window is closing — only the strongest setups are worth entering after 11 AM.
              - Valid exceptions: pullback-to-VWAP entries (price just crossed back above VWAP with volume confirmation) and genuine ORB breakouts are still valid at any time of day.

            Be concise — keep all reasoning fields under 2 sentences each.

    Final portfolio-level gate before a trade decision reaches the executor.

    This task acts as a circuit-breaker for portfolio concentration:

            Analyze {ticker} for a GAP FADE opportunity using this market data:
            - Previous close:    {market_data.previous_close}
            - Estimated open:   {open_price}
            - Current price:    {market_data.current_price}
            - Gap %:            {market_data.gap_pct}%
            - VWAP:             {market_data.vwap}
            - VWAP margin %:    {vwap_margin_pct}%
            - RSI:              {market_data.rsi}
            - Volume ratio:     {market_data.volume_ratio}x
            - Pre-market price: {market_data.pre_market_price}

            Gap fading means trading AGAINST the gap direction, expecting price to revert.
            Gap-up fade: trade SHORT (opened too high, expect pullback toward previous close).
            Gap-down fade: trade LONG (opened too low, expect bounce toward previous close).

            Evaluate each of these four signals and count how many are confirmed:

            Signal 1 — Gap size (minimum threshold):
            - Gap-up fade:   gap_pct >= +5% = CONFIRMED ✓  |  gap_pct < +5% = NOT confirmed ✗
            - Gap-down fade: gap_pct <= -5% = CONFIRMED ✓  |  gap_pct > -5% = NOT confirmed ✗

            Signal 2 — RSI extreme:
            - Gap-up fade:   RSI > 70 (overbought) = CONFIRMED ✓  |  RSI <= 70 = NOT confirmed ✗
            - Gap-down fade: RSI < 30 (oversold)   = CONFIRMED ✓  |  RSI >= 30 = NOT confirmed ✗

            Signal 3 — Price extended from VWAP in gap direction:
            - Gap-up fade:   vwap_margin_pct >= +1.5% = CONFIRMED ✓  |  < +1.5% = NOT confirmed ✗
            - Gap-down fade: vwap_margin_pct <= -1.5% = CONFIRMED ✓  |  > -1.5% = NOT confirmed ✗

            Signal 4 — Volume declining from opening spike:
            - volume_ratio < 1.5 = CONFIRMED ✓ (opening surge fading)  |  >= 1.5 = NOT confirmed ✗

            Count how many of the 4 signals are confirmed (0–4).
            IMPORTANT: Only recommend execute=true if at least 3 signals are confirmed.
            If fewer than 3 signals are confirmed, set execute=false with low confidence.

            You MUST return a JSON object with these exact fields:
            - execute: true or false
            - direction: 'short' (gap-up fade) or 'long' (gap-down fade) or null if execute=false
            - confidence: float between 0.0 and 1.0
            - gap_fade_target: reversion target — previous_close or VWAP, whichever is closer to current price — or null if execute=false
            - reasoning: analysis including signal count e.g. "3/4 signals confirmed" (minimum 50 characters)

            Only set execute=true if confidence >= {config.confidence_threshold}.
            Be concise — keep reasoning under 3 sentences, key_factors to 2-4 items.

def create_vwap_reversion_task(agent, ticker: str, market_data) -> Task:
    vwap_margin_pct = (
        round((market_data.current_price - market_data.vwap) / market_data.vwap * 100, 2)

            Analyze {ticker} for a VWAP REVERSION opportunity using this market data:
            - Current price: {market_data.current_price}
            - VWAP:          {market_data.vwap}
            - VWAP margin %: {vwap_margin_pct}%
            - RSI:           {market_data.rsi}
            - ATR %:         {market_data.atr_pct}%
            - Volume ratio:  {market_data.volume_ratio}x

            VWAP reversion means trading BACK TOWARD VWAP when price is extended from it.
            Long reversion: price is below VWAP, expect a bounce up to VWAP.
            Short reversion: price is above VWAP, expect a pullback down to VWAP.

            Evaluate each of these four signals and count how many are confirmed:

            Signal 1 — VWAP extension (minimum threshold):
            - Long reversion:  vwap_margin_pct <= -1.5% = CONFIRMED ✓  |  > -1.5% = NOT confirmed ✗
            - Short reversion: vwap_margin_pct >= +1.5% = CONFIRMED ✓  |  < +1.5% = NOT confirmed ✗

            Signal 2 — RSI reversal signal:
            - Long reversion:  RSI < 40 (oversold, ready to bounce)    = CONFIRMED ✓  |  RSI >= 40 = NOT confirmed ✗
            - Short reversion: RSI > 60 (overbought, ready to fade)    = CONFIRMED ✓  |  RSI <= 60 = NOT confirmed ✗

            Signal 3 — 2-bar momentum flattening:
            - Momentum < 0.1% in the extension direction = CONFIRMED ✓ (move stalling)
            - Interpret from RSI: if RSI is within 3 points of its recent extreme, treat as flattening
            - Still accelerating away from VWAP = NOT confirmed ✗

            Signal 4 — Volume declining:
            - volume_ratio < 1.0 (below average, exhaustion confirmed) = CONFIRMED ✓  |  >= 1.0 = NOT confirmed ✗

            Count how many of the 4 signals are confirmed (0–4).
            IMPORTANT: Only recommend execute=true if at least 3 signals are confirmed.
            If fewer than 3 signals are confirmed, set execute=false with low confidence.

            You MUST return a JSON object with these exact fields:
            - execute: true or false
            - direction: 'long' (reversion up to VWAP) or 'short' (reversion down to VWAP) or null if execute=false
            - confidence: float between 0.0 and 1.0
            - vwap_target: current VWAP value as the price target, or null if execute=false
            - reasoning: analysis including signal count e.g. "3/4 signals confirmed" (minimum 50 characters)

            Only set execute=true if confidence >= {config.confidence_threshold}.
